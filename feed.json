Until I find a proper solution for my buggy Spotlight, I have switched to Raycast. Raycast is an app launcher with a lot of productivity features and extendability baked in. It is actually very nice. So far, it has even completely replaced my window manager, Rectangle, which I have otherwise been very happy about.

It has very few requirements. But it is based on Publii, which is an applications that runs only on a specific computer, or computers with access to a shared drive, which means I don't have access to a backend from the web.</p>\n<p>I want a content management system I can access from the web.

Where and how can I run a database for free? Where can I host a backend? How can I make the necessary build steps?</p>\n<p>So far, so good. I just startet a side project.
