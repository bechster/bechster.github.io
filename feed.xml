                <p>What‚Äôs the difference between a carousel, a swiper and a slider? The terms are used interchangeably, but I would argue, there‚Äôs a semantic difference. A definition:</p>
<p><strong>Carousels</strong> are circular. They start over once you reach the last item.</p>
<p><strong>Swipers</strong> are linear. You can swipe back and forth, but once you reach the last item, you can‚Äôt swipe any further.</p>
<p><strong>Sliders</strong> are input elements (e.g. volume controls), and thus entirely different UI components.</p>
<h2>Use Carousels/Swipers Sparingly</h2>
<p>However, carousels/swipers in UI design are mostly internal shut up candy. They enable content managers to satisfy stakeholders by telling them "your content is located on position 6 in the carousel‚Äù.</p>
<p>In reality, research, including my own, suggests users rarely engage with content hidden behind the swipe. Instead, consider replacing the carousel with a static element, maybe including a queue, that updates the content either randomly or within a given time frame.</p>
<p>Nielsen Norman Group wrote an article on carousel usability back in 2013:<br><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="status-link unhandled-link" title="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/designing-effective-carousels/"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">nngroup.com/articles/designing</span><span class="invisible">-effective-carousels/</span></a></p>
<p>Although that‚Äôs an old one, results seem to apply on mobile devices as well: <br><a href="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-carousels/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer" class="status-link unhandled-link" title="https://www.nngroup.com/articles/mobile-carousels/"><span class="invisible">https://www.</span><span class="ellipsis">nngroup.com/articles/mobile-ca</span><span class="invisible">rousels/</span></a></p>

                <p>Of all my messaging apps, and for various reasons I have quite a few installed on my devices, Element is my new favourite.</p>
<p>Element is a free and open source instant messaging client based on the Matrix protocol. It supports end-to-end encryption, groups and channels and is available as a web app, desktop- and mobile apps.¬†</p>
<p>It has a nice, clean UI and I feel quite confident the encryption and the decentralized architecture of the Matrix network keeps my conversations private and out of reach from BigCorp‚Ñ¢ algorithms.</p>
<p>The biggest hurdle, though, is getting all my contacts, who neither understand the advantages of encryption and decentralization, nor care about privacy and algorithms, to make the move from Facebook Messenger ü§î</p>
<p>The common perception seems to be that if it solves your problem and everbody's there, then why should you move? Sadly, the power of habit is hard to break.</p>

                <p>I used to use Spotlight Search in macOS as an app launcher. Unfortunately, it broke after upgrading to macOS 13.1. For some reason it is suddenly unable to find preinstalled apps as well as system apps, like System Settings, Text Edit, Safari, Mail, Calendar, Messages, Facetime, Font Book etc. Oddly enough it is still able to find Pages, Numbers, and Keynote, as well as any user installed app.¬†<br><br>I have tried reindexing Spotlight, both via the System setting UI and with the terminal command <code>sudo mdutil -E /</code>. That didn't seem to fix the problem. I submitted a bug to Apple and if you come across this problem, you should too. <a href="https://feedbackassistant.apple.com/">You can submit feedback to Apple here</a><br><br>Long story short. Until I find a proper solution for my buggy Spotlight, I have switched to Raycast. Raycast is an app launcher with a lot of productivity features and extendability baked in. It is actually very nice. So far, it has even completely replaced my window manager, Rectangle, which I have otherwise been very happy about. Maybe I'm going to let Raycast replace Spotlight for good?<br><br><a href="https://www.raycast.com/">You can find Raycast here</a><br><br>If you have any ideas about how to fix a broken Spotlight, I'll be happy to hear about it.</p>

                <p><strong>RSS Revisited:</strong> Back in the day when RSS was the shizzle-bizzle you used to look for the little orange icon with the dot and the three arcs, when you wanted to subscribe to your favorite blogs. Since then, big corp social media kind of hijacked the feed concept because like RSS, everything came flowing in your stream, although in an annoyingly arbitrary way due to algorithms. Gone was the timeline.</p>
<p>Today, some big social media companies seem to be struggling, though, and thus the concept of RSS may yet again rise and spread its wings. So while the orange RSS icons are mostly gone, how do you find relevant RSS feeds today?</p>
<h2>Feedle to the rescue</h2>
<p>Feedle is a search engine for blogs and podcasts. Not only does it let you find and follow relevant RSS feeds, it also lets you subscribe to search results which led you there. Nice, right?</p>

<h2>I want to learn during the process</h2>
<p>This blog is <a href="https://getpublii.com/">made with Publii</a>. It is really easy and simple to set up and it works great for static site building. Please try it out, if you just want an easy to use blog system.</p>
<p>I already own a WordPress site and I've set up a lot of WordPress solutions through the time. But it feels a little old fasioned, it is kind of too easy for me and it teaches me nothing.¬†</p>
<p>However, I work with Vue and Nuxt on a daily basis, but I mostly just make commits to a system that has already been deployed. I have never set up and, more importantly, deployed a Nuxt solution from the bottom. I want to learn how to do that.</p>
<h2>I want a CMS</h2>
<p>This blog is a static site running on Github Pages. It has very few requirements. But it is based on Publii, which is an applications that runs only on a specific computer, or computers with access to a shared drive, which means I don't have access to a backend from the web.</p>
<p>I want a content management system I can access from the web. However, that makes it a bit more complicated, because then it involves a database.</p>
<p>I also want to go Jamstack, which means the frontend has to be completely decoupled from the backend so that involves a JSON or a GraphQL API,</p>
<h2>I want it to be free</h2>
<p>This blog costs me nothing but time to run because Github Pages are free to use if your requirements aren't too heavy.¬†</p>
<p>So I also need to work out the devops. Where and how can I run a database for free? Where can I host a backend? How can I make the necessary build steps?</p>
<p>So far, so good. I just startet a side project. I already know it is going to take some time. But I'll try to describe my steps along the way.</p>
