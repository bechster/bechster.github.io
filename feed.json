I have set some goals for the project:¬†</p>\n<h2>I want to learn during the process</h2>\n<p>This blog is <a href=\"https://getpublii.com/\">made with Publii</a>. It is really easy and simple to set up and it works great for static site building. Please try it out, if you just want an easy to use blog system.</p>\n<p>I already own a WordPress site and I've set up a lot of WordPress solutions through the time. But it feels a little old fasioned, it is kind of too easy for me and it teaches me nothing.¬†</p>\n<p>However, I work with Vue and Nuxt on a daily basis, but I mostly just make commits to a system that has already been deployed. I have never set up and, more importantly, deployed a Nuxt solution from the bottom. I want to learn how to do that.</p>\n<h2>I want a CMS</h2>\n<p>This blog is a static site running on Github Pages. It has very few requirements. But it is based on Publii, which is an applications that runs only on a specific computer, or computers with access to a shared drive, which means I don't have access to a backend from the web.</p>\n<p>I want a content management system I can access from the web. However, that makes it a bit more complicated, because then it involves a database.</p>\n<p>I also want to go Jamstack, which means the frontend has to be completely decoupled from the backend so that involves a JSON or a GraphQL API,</p>\n<h2>I want it to be free</h2>\n<p>This blog costs me nothing but time to run because Github Pages are free to use if your requirements aren't too heavy.¬†</p>\n<p>So I also need to work out the devops. Where and how can I run a database for free? Where can I host a backend? How can I make the necessary build steps?</p>\n<p>So far, so good. I just startet a side project. I already know it is going to take some time. But I'll try to describe my steps along the way.</p>\n<p>This post is part 1 of the series \"A new blog\".</p>",
