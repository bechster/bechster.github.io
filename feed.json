            "content_html": "<p><strong>RSS Revisited:</strong> Back in the day when RSS was the shizzle-bizzle you used to look for the little orange icon with the dot and the three arcs, when you wanted to subscribe to your favorite blogs. Since then, big corp social media kind of hijacked the feed concept because like RSS, everything came flowing in your stream, although in an annoyingly arbitrary way due to algorithms. Gone was the timeline.</p>\n<p>Today, some big social media companies seem to be struggling, though, and thus the concept of RSS may yet again rise and spread its wings. So while the orange RSS icons are mostly gone, how do you find relevant RSS feeds today?</p>\n<h2>Feedle to the rescue</h2>\n<p>Feedle is a search engine for blogs and podcasts. Not only does it let you find and follow relevant RSS feeds, it also lets you subscribe to search results which led you there. Nice, right?</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://feedle.world/\">Go try it out at feedle.world</a></p>",

It is really easy and simple to set up and it works great for static site building. Please try it out, if you just want an easy to use blog system.</p>\n<p>I already own a WordPress site and I've set up a lot of WordPress solutions through the time. But it feels a little old fasioned, it is kind of too easy for me and it teaches me nothing. </p>\n<p>However, I work with Vue and Nuxt on a daily basis, but I mostly just make commits to a system that has already been deployed. I have never set up and, more importantly, deployed a Nuxt solution from the bottom. I want to learn how to do that.</p>\n<h2>I want a CMS</h2>\n<p>This blog is a static site running on Github Pages. It has very few requirements. But it is based on Publii, which is an applications that runs only on a specific computer, or computers with access to a shared drive, which means I don't have access to a backend from the web.</p>\n<p>I want a content management system I can access from the web. However, that makes it a bit more complicated, because then it involves a database.</p>\n<p>I also want to go Jamstack, which means the frontend has to be completely decoupled from the backend so that involves a JSON or a GraphQL API,</p>\n<h2>I want it to be free</h2>\n<p>This blog costs me nothing but time to run because Github Pages are free to use if your requirements aren't too heavy. </p>\n<p>So I also need to work out the devops. Where and how can I run a database for free? Where can I host a backend? How can I make the necessary build steps?</p>\n<p>So far, so good. I just startet a side project. I already know it is going to take some time. But I'll try to describe my steps along the way.</p>\n<p>This post is part 1 of the series \"A new blog\".</p>",
